# Theory: Norton's Theorem

## Introduction

Norton's Theorem is a fundamental principle used in the analysis of electrical circuits. It simplifies a complex linear electrical network into an equivalent circuit with a single current source and parallel resistance. This theorem is especially helpful in analyzing power systems and simplifying load calculations.



## Statement of Norton's Theorem

**"Any two-terminal linear network containing voltage sources and resistances can be replaced by an equivalent current source in parallel with a resistance."**

In simpler terms:
- The **Norton equivalent current (I‚Çõùí∏)** is the current through a short circuit placed across the terminals.
- The **Norton equivalent resistance (R‚Çô)** is the resistance measured across the terminals when all independent sources are replaced by their internal resistances (voltage sources shorted, current sources opened).



## Norton‚Äôs Equivalent Circuit

The original circuit is replaced by:
- A **current source (I‚Çõùí∏)** in parallel with
- A **resistor (R‚Çô)**

This combination behaves identically to the original network when viewed from the load terminals.



## Steps to Apply Norton‚Äôs Theorem

1. **Remove the Load Resistor (R·¥∏)** from the original circuit.
2. **Find the Norton Current (I‚Çõùí∏)**:
   - Short the load terminals and calculate the current through the short (I‚Çõùí∏).
3. **Find the Norton Resistance (R‚Çô)**:
   - Deactivate all independent sources:
     - Replace voltage sources with short circuits.
     - Replace current sources with open circuits.
   - Find the equivalent resistance across the open load terminals (R‚Çô).
4. **Draw the Norton Equivalent Circuit**:
   - Connect I‚Çõùí∏ and R‚Çô in parallel.
   - Reconnect the original load resistor R·¥∏ across this parallel combination.
5. **Calculate Load Current (I‚Çó)**:
   - Using the formula:
     \[
     I‚Çó = I‚Çõùí∏ \cdot \frac{R·¥∏}{R‚Çô + R·¥∏}
     \]



## Applications of Norton‚Äôs Theorem

- Simplifies complex circuit analysis.
- Widely used in power system analysis.
- Helps in analyzing load sharing and current division.
- Useful in Thevenin-Norton transformations.



## Important Notes

- Applicable only to **linear bilateral networks**.
- Independent sources must be deactivated correctly when finding R‚Çô.
- Norton‚Äôs Theorem is **dual** to Thevenin‚Äôs Theorem.
